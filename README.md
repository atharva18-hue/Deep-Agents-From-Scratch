##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of AI agents capable of:

- **Task Planning:** Multi-step workflow management using TODO lists  
- **Virtual File System:** Store and retrieve agent memory efficiently  
- **Sub-agent Delegation:** Parallelize tasks while isolating context  
- **ReAct Loops:** Reasoning + acting agent foundation  
- **Modular & Extendable:** Easily integrate new tools and agents  

The project is structured in **5 progressive notebooks**, each building upon the previous:

| Notebook | Focus | Key Learnings |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| `0_create_agent.ipynb` | Agent initialization | Setup ReAct loop for reasoning + acting |
| `1_todo.ipynb` | Task planning | Track tasks, manage status, prevent drift |
| `2_files.ipynb` | Virtual file system | Store agent state, reduce token usage |
| `3_subagents.ipynb` | Sub-agent delegation | Context isolation, parallel workflows |
| `4_full_agent.ipynb` | Full research agent | Combine all modules into a production-ready agent |
