## **Project Overview**

This project is a personal implementation of **advanced AI agents** built entirely from scratch. It demonstrates how to design and execute intelligent agents capable of **task planning, context management, and sub-agent delegation**. The system is inspired by modern AI research platforms and is structured to handle complex, multi-step workflows efficiently.

Key objectives of this project include:

- **Task Planning:** Agents can organize tasks into structured TODO lists, track progress, and manage multi-step workflows autonomously.
- **Context Management:** Agents maintain persistent state through a virtual file system, allowing them to remember information across tasks and sessions.
- **Sub-Agent Delegation:** Tasks can be split across multiple specialized sub-agents, ensuring efficient parallel execution and context isolation.
- **ReAct Loops:** The agents implement a Reason-Act loop framework, which forms the foundation for decision-making and problem-solving.
- **Extensibility:** The architecture is modular, allowing new tools or agent capabilities to be integrated easily.

The project includes Jupyter notebooks that progressively build a fully functional AI agent system, starting from simple task execution to advanced research agents capable of handling real-world research workflows.

 ##  Visuals

The visuals in this project illustrate the architecture and workflow of the AI agents:

- **Agent Architecture Diagram:**  
  This diagram shows the complete flow of the agent system:
  1. **Task Planning:** The agent first organizes tasks into structured TODO lists and sets priorities.
  2. **Context Storage:** Task-related data, intermediate results, and conversation context are stored in a virtual file system, enabling agent memory across sessions.
  3. **Sub-Agent Delegation:** Complex tasks are split among specialized sub-agents. Each sub-agent handles a focused subset of tools and responsibilities, preventing confusion and task interference.
  4. **Full Agent Execution:** The master agent orchestrates all tasks and sub-agents, combining results into a final output.

- **Workflow & ReAct Loops:**  
  Visualizations also demonstrate the **Reason-Act (ReAct) loop**, showing how agents continuously observe the state, reason about the next action, and execute tasks effectively.

- **State & File Management Diagrams:**  
  Illustrates how virtual files are created, read, and updated by agents to offload context, ensuring efficient token usage and persistent memory.

- **Sub-Agent Interaction Diagrams:**  
  Depicts how sub-agents collaborate in parallel, allowing multiple tasks to progress simultaneously without interfering with each other.

These visuals help users understand **how the agent processes tasks, manages context, delegates work, and produces results** in a structured, modular, and scalable manner.
